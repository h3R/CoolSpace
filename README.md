# CoolSpace
Is a first aproach to game engines i ever made, made for Juegos Electronicos in UPF. The game is about how two factions gather and manage resources to comfront each other. Each faction has three types of drones: fighters, defenders, recollectors. How you manage this resources in fighting, deffending or gathering matherial depends on you.

I have focused on the feel of the space environment and how spaceships would maneouver in a space fight. Each drone has a behaviour and a certain actions related to each behaviour like fighting, avoiding attacks, flee, recollect...

The game is developed to be played with a ps3 controller using the **motioninjoy** tool. Also is required to install few dependencies.
